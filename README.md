# Printf tests


`make` or `make a` : run mandatory and bonus tests \
`make m` : run mandatory tests \
`make b`: run bonus tests \
`make custom` : run custom tests (you can change the file `custom_tests.c`)

Note : These tests will run properly if you have implemented ft_vprintf. Otherwise, you can modify the test file to use printf and ft_printf for comparison of each case.
